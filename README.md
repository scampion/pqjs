Transformer-based Embedding Retrieval with Product Quantization for Edge Computing
=================================================================================

Implementation of "vector database" embedded in the browser thanks to JS and Product Quantization compression. 
Thanks to the Transformer.js library the query is computed in the web page.
The asymmetric distance computation is done also locally thanks to the codewords and pqcodes, finally, a heap sort is used to find similar vectors.
